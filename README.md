# RISCV-Mini-1

**Type**: RISC-V Single-Cycle Processor  

## Architecture Overview  
This processor is a 32-bit architecture that executes instructions within a single clock cycle.

## Instruction Formats  
The processor supports multiple instruction formats, each tailored for specific types of operations:  
- **R-Type**: Used for operations between registers (e.g., add, subtract).  
- **I-Type**: Handles immediate values and load instructions (e.g., addi, lw).  
- **S-Type**: Facilitates store instructions (e.g., sw).  
- **SB-Type**: Implements conditional branching (e.g., beq, bne).

## Pipeline  
The single-cycle processor completes all instruction stages (fetch, decode, execute, memory access, write-back) in one clock cycle, without pipelining.  

## Key Components  
- **Program Counter (PC)**:  
  Holds the memory address of the next instruction to be executed, incremented after every instruction fetch.  

- **Instruction Memory**:  
  Stores the program's instructions and retrieves the instruction pointed to by the PC.  

- **Register File**:  
  Contains 32 general-purpose registers for read and write operations, facilitating fast data access for ALU operations.  

- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**:  
  Performs arithmetic and logical operations, including addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, and OR. Operates based on control signals generated by the Control Unit.  

- **Immediate Generator**:  
  Decodes and sign-extends immediate values from instruction fields for operations requiring constants.  

- **Control Unit**:  
  Deciphers the opcode of the instruction and generates control signals that dictate data flow and operation within the processor.  

- **Data Memory**:  
  Provides read and write capabilities during load (e.g., `lw`) and store (e.g., `sw`) instructions.  

- **Multiplexers (MUX)**:  
  Route data to appropriate destinations based on control signals. For example, select between immediate values or register data as ALU inputs.  

## Control Signals  
- ALUSrc  
- MemtoReg  
- MemRead/MemWrite  
- RegWrite  
- Branch  
- ALUOp  

## Supported Operations  
- Arithmetic: Addition, subtraction.  
- Logical: AND, OR.  
- Memory Access: Load (`lw`), store (`sw`).  
- Branching: Conditional branches (`beq`, `bne`).
